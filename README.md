\# Energy-Constrained Laminar Cortical Network Model



This repository contains the code accompanying the manuscript:



"Energy, excitability, and epilepsy: The impact of cellular energy depletion on cortical network synchrony and information processing"



\## Overview



We implement a laminar cortical column model with:

\- Energy-dependent mAdExp neurons

\- AMPA, NMDA, GABA synapses

\- Potjans \& Diesmann connectivity

\- LFP approximation

\- Metabolic disruption experiments



The model is implemented in Brian2.
